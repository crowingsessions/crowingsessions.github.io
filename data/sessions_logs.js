      <p>This session focus was mobile development and the speakers did a great job with their presentations, talks and were amazing because they also handled pretty well the fload of question and discussion that happen! It was awesome to feel the audiance engaged and excited with the subjects.</p>
      <p>Iolanda Rosa, explored the pros and cons of going with the mobile-first development approach, highlighting some of the conseguences that could bring to the team, company and client, but also giving some good advecises for those who decided to go with it.</p>
      <p>Rodrigo Sa Pessoa, spoke about Hybrid Mobile Apps development - why and when they can be a good solution to your project; and how and why they are evolving so fast. he start by exploring a little bit the differences about Native Vs Hybrid and finish the talk explaining enthusiastically the IONIC Framework and doing a simple showcase with it.</p>
      <p>Just a simple quote by Tim O’Reilly "What new technology does is create new opportunities to do a job that customers want done."</p>
      <p>Key points:<ul><li>Architecture</li><li>Backend</li><li>Mobile</li><li>Development</li></ul></p>

    "speakers": [{ "slug": "bruno-januario", "name": "Bruno Januário" }],
    "description": `
      <p>During this session, it was briefly explained what is the quantum computation and some of its applicability in the real and "software" worlds, using the showcase of IBM Quantum - State of the Union. Although the subject was/is highly complex, the speaker tried to make it more accessible as possible, showing some examples and being open to a good discussion at the end on Q & A!</p>
      <p>For privacy and legal reasons from IBM's side, we were not allowed to record the session. However, we will share some of the key points of the session and if you have any questions or want to know more about the subject, feel free to reach <a href="https://crowingsessions.github.io/#speaker-article-bruno-januario">Bruno Januário</a>, he is a very approachable person.</p>
      <p>Keypoints:
      <ul>
      <li>Quantum computing is a huge technological step for mankind and it is happening much faster than anticipated;</li>
      <li>There are even several private (financial, technological, etc..) and government entities investing a lot of money in this area - we are talking about billions due to the advantages that this technology brings to the world;</li>
      <li>There are already real applications (usages) such as in industries: pharmaceutical (to test medicines) and automotive (BMW, Mercedes, etc...) among others;</li>
      <li>In the same way that ChatGPT will not do or serve to do everything, QC also has/will have its uses due to the context;</li>
      <li>It is an area that is in need of software developers because in the end it is just hardware made by physicists but now there is a lack of developers to start expanding its uses;</li>
      <li>Recently (in papers) it has already been possible to decipher RSA "keys" (this shows how powerful this is)</li>
      <li>Processors are smaller than people think;</li>
      <li>There is parallelism of quantum computing and classical computing and this combination makes things even faster;</li>
      <li>Programming in QC is just a paradigm shift which may initially seem strange but deep down is very similar to what is already being done with other languages/frameworks;</li>
      <li>IBM has a free program that allows - for free - to program in QC - this is virtualization not a dedicated quantum computer, please check <a href="https://qiskit.org/">qiskit website</a> for a better understanding - in fact they really encourage that people start using it and that people experiment as much as they can; and there's still the <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/next-wave-quantum-centric-supercomputing">100x100 challenge</a> with a lot more information about this subject</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>Sorry for not having a video recording but we hope that this helps a little, thank you in advance!</p>

    "description": `
      <p>On this session we had two guests that approched two subjects that are essencial in software development and architecture.</p>
      <p>Lee Reis, Senior Software Developer in VOID, confronted monolithic and microservices architectures by briefly comparing both not in "school" way but rather from a business and development presctive using is own experience explaing cons and pros of each and also exposing the cost of migration from monolithic to microservices. Point out that neither of the solutions is perfect, it will always depends on the project and the vison and goals of it. Like Lee said "It depends..." (team members, project nature, costs, ...) there's no correct answer for this.</p>
      <p>Celso Santos, Solutions Architect in Evooq, present a "moral and ethic" way of how somehow be a better/succeful human (programmer) while doing code review and how to be a good team member. This may seem not to be crucial but in fact code review is a very important step in software development, because can make the sofware more robust and stable through time and the developers more confortable to manage it (either new features, bug fixes, etc...)</p>
      <p>Quoting Celso Santos quoting Philip Greenspun "... programmers are very unlikable people ... In aviation, for example, people who greatly overestimate their level of skill are all dead."</p>
      <p>Key points:<ul><li>Architecture</li><li>Monolithic</li><li>Microservices</li><li>Code review</li><li>Solutions</li><li>Team work</li></ul></p>
      <p>P.S:<ul><li>This was the first time we had a hybrid session (presential and remote), it was nice to see and feel people's energy and good vibe during the session and networking while munching on some snacks, pizza and beer (there was also other beverages)</li><li>We had two new sponsors: <a href=”https://www.void.pt/” target="_blank">VOID Software</a> that provided an amazing venue <b>(VOID Academy)</b> with great conditions and staff; and <a href=”https://www.valispace.com/” target="_blank">Valispace</a> that boost our confidence with their t-shirts "Trust me I'm an Engineer"</li></ul></p>

    "title": "What the Amish can teach us about technology",
    "speakers": [{ "slug": "daniel-mulroy", "name": "Daniel Mulroy" }],
    "description": `
      <p>Our guest, Daniel Mulroy, chose an approach a bit more intimate, using his own life experience, leading us approximately to a conclusion (at least for me) that we must use technology with a purpose more: human; smart; useful and really necessary for society. Also this presentation had two pauses - Thought experiments - to make participants reflex before Daniel expose next topics, doing so a more dynamic and interesting experience.</p>
      <p>First "Thought experiment" (2 minutes after the beginning), split participants in groups - which make some feel a little uncomfortable, I must confess, but on the other hand it was a great start for the following and engagement of them into the presentation. This experiment was composed by three questions:
      <blockquote>What power would you want to have more than anything else?<br/>What would you do with that power? How would your days or life be different?<br/>Do wizards, because of their exceptional ability, have a moral responsibility to help society maintain peace and prosperity?<br/>
      </blockquote>Was nice to check how people "locate" themselves morally with their power in society.</p>
      <p>Second "Thought experiment 2", split participants again in groups but now instead of questions just brought up a situation:<blockquote>A friend approaches you to work on a new project: a "Magic Dinner" machine that cooks meals that are exactly as tasty and healthy as made by hand.
      </blockquote>Making us wondering about the impact that a "perfect" solution could bring to us, to our families, neighbors, ... basically to the all world.</p>
      <p>Key points:<ul><li>Responsibility</li><li>Society</li><li>Useful</li><li>Necessity</li><li>Moral</li></ul></p>
      <p>Just before you "fly away" (using bird jokes) I'm going to let you one quote from Daniel's presentation "He who has never done anything wrong has never done anything right"... Think about it and see ya soon 🙂</p>
